DevByte - Starter Code
======================

Use as starter code for the Repository codelab.

Introduction
------------

DevByteViewer app displays a list of DevByte videos. DevByte videos are short
videos made by the Google Android developer relations team to introduce new
developer features on Android. They're also a great way to stay up to date with
new features as they come out as well as tips and best practices. This app
fetches the DevByte video list from the network using the Retrofit library and
displays it on the screen. It uses a ViewModel and LiveData to hold the data and
update the UI. Since the video list is big, results are displayed in a
RecyclerView.
